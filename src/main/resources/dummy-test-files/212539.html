1)  Start browser with a clean install and clean profile
2)  Open &quot;View&quot; menu

EXPECTED RESULTS: Able to see entire dialog, including button to dismiss the dialog

ACTUAL RESULTS: Dialog is too small; content cut off

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >brois, 
my understanding to the problem is that when the row of button/checbox/selectbox
is too long to fit in the window, it will push the content of the dialog beyond
the border. In this sense, the problem arises when the font of a particular
system makes that button/checkbox/selectbox bar too long to fit in the window,
no matter it is default or customize font size or not (of course it is a much
more serious problem when the bug is visible when user is using standard/default
font size, but the underlying problem is still the same :))</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Yes, I am quite aware of what is causing the problems, thank you. 
Nevertheless,
there are two main ways of fixing <a href="show_bug.cgi?id=171454" title="NEW - [cust] Customize toolbar windows is incorrectly sized when using larger fonts">bug 171454</a>:

1)  Address the real problem (the fact that the dialog is sized in one set of
    units and its contents in another).
2)  Change the size of the fonts used in the dialog (eg by using style rules).

Depending on which course of action is taken, this bug may or may not get
fixed.

In any case, I think further comments on this bug are superfluous till either
<a href="show_bug.cgi?id=171454" title="NEW - [cust] Customize toolbar windows is incorrectly sized when using larger fonts">bug 171454</a> is fixed or this bug is marked duplicate of it.</pre>
